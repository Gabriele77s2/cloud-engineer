# Programming

1. **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem or performing a task in a computer program.

2. **Code**: Instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute.

3. **Programming Language**: A formal language with a set of rules and syntax used to write computer programs. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

4. **Compiler**: A program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code that can be executed by a computer.

5. **Interpreter**: A program that reads and executes source code directly, translating and executing it line by line without the need for compilation.

6. **Variable**: A named storage location in a program's memory that holds data or values that can change during program execution.

7. **Data Type**: A classification that specifies which type of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or custom objects.

8. **Function**: A self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are often designed to be reusable.

9. **Statement**: A single line of code that performs a specific action, such as assigning a value to a variable or calling a function.

10. **Control Structure**: Constructs like loops (e.g., for and while) and conditional statements (e.g., if, else) that control the flow of a program.

11. **Comment**: A non-executable line of text in the source code used to provide explanations or notes to programmers. Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter.

12. **Syntax**: The set of rules and conventions that dictate the structure and format of valid code in a programming language.

13. **Bug**: An error, flaw, or mistake in a program that causes it to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results.

14. **Debugging**: The process of identifying and fixing bugs or errors in a program to make it work correctly.

15. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: A software application that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. Examples include Visual Studio, PyCharm, and Eclipse.

16. **Version Control**: The practice of tracking and managing changes to source code over time, typically using systems like Git, SVN, or Mercurial.

17. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how functions or services can be accessed and used.

18. **Library**: A collection of pre-written code, functions, and routines that can be reused to simplify and expedite programming tasks.

19. **Framework**: A structured and reusable foundation for building software applications. Frameworks provide a set of tools, conventions, and best practices for development.

20. **Debugging Tools**: Software tools and utilities designed to assist programmers in identifying and resolving coding errors and issues.

21. **Algorithm Complexity**: The measure of the computational resources (time and memory) required to execute an algorithm, often expressed as Big O notation.

22. **Concurrency**: The execution of multiple tasks or processes simultaneously in a program, often used for improving performance in multi-core systems.

23. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.

24. **Scripting Language**: A type of programming language designed for automating tasks and quickly writing small programs or scripts.

25. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**: The process of planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications.

26. **Agile Development**: An iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback.

27. **Refactoring**: The process of restructuring existing code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance without changing its external behavior.

28. **Legacy Code**: Older or outdated code that is still in use and may be difficult to maintain or update due to its age or lack of documentation.

29. **Open Source**: Software that is distributed with a license that allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the source code freely.

30. **Code Review**: The practice of systematically examining and evaluating source code to identify issues, ensure adherence to coding standards, and improve code quality.

31. **Versioning**: The practice of assigning unique version numbers to software releases to track changes, improvements, and updates over time.

32. **Software Architecture**: The high-level design and structure of a software system, defining its components, modules, and their interactions.

33. **API Documentation**: Detailed information about how to use an API, including function descriptions, input parameters, and expected output.

34. **Database**: A structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval, storage, and management, often used in software applications to store and retrieve information.

35. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases.

36. **Bug Tracking System**: Software tools and systems used by development teams to log, manage, and track the progress of bug fixes and feature requests.

37. **Scalability**: The ability of a software system to handle increasing workloads or user demand by adding resources or optimizing performance.

38. **Codebase**: The entire source code of a software project, including all files, modules, and dependencies.

39. **Dependency Management**: The process of handling external libraries, modules, and packages required by a software project to ensure proper integration and version control.

40. **Integration Testing**: The phase of software testing that focuses on ensuring that different components of a system work together as expected.

41. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A development practice that involves automatically building, testing, and integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect and fix issues early in the development process.

42. **Code Review**: A systematic examination of source code by peers to find defects, ensure code quality, and share knowledge.

43. **Agile Methodologies**: A set of software development methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban, that emphasize iterative and collaborative development, adaptability, and customer feedback.

44. **Waterfall Model**: A traditional software development methodology that follows a linear and sequential approach, with distinct phases such as requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment.

45. **Repository**: A storage location where version-controlled source code, documents, and other files are managed and tracked, often using systems like Git or SVN.

46. **Algorithmic Complexity**: The analysis of the computational resources required to run an algorithm, typically measured in terms of time complexity (how long it takes) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).

47. **Legacy System**: An outdated or older software system or application that continues to be used due to its critical role but may be challenging to maintain or upgrade.

48. **Framework**: A pre-built structure or set of tools and libraries that provide a foundation for developing specific types of applications, such as web applications or game development.

49. **Version Control System (VCS)**: Software tools like Git and Subversion that manage changes to source code, enabling multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and track revisions.

50. **Regression Testing**: The process of retesting a software application after changes or updates to ensure that new features or fixes have not introduced new defects or broken existing functionality.
