28. **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** A company that provides internet access to customers.

29. **File Extension:** A suffix at the end of a filename that indicates the type of file, such as .jpg for images or .txt for text files.

30. **Backup:** Copying and storing data in a secure location to prevent data loss.

31. **Server:** A computer or software system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

32. **Virtualization:** The process of creating virtual instances of hardware or software, often used in server management and cloud computing.

33. **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

34. **Compiler:** Software that translates human-readable source code into machine code that a computer can execute.

35. **Scripting Language:** A programming language used for automating tasks and writing scripts, such as JavaScript and Python.

36. **Cache Memory:** High-speed volatile computer memory that stores frequently used instructions and data to improve processing speed.

37. **Firewall:** A network security device or software that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect against threats.

38. **Bit:** The smallest unit of digital information, representing either a 0 or a 1 in binary code.

39. **Byte:** A group of 8 bits, often used to represent a single character of text or a small piece of data.

40. **ISP (Instruction Set Architecture):** A set of instructions and registers that a CPU can execute and use.

41. **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):** A firmware interface between a computer's operating system and hardware components.

42. **Open Source:** Software that is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone.

43. **Kernel:** The core component of an operating system that manages hardware resources and provides essential services.

44. **Database:** A structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and management, often used for storing large datasets.
