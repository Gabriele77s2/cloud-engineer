# Terraform

1. **Terraform**:
   Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IAC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**:
   IAC is a methodology for managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation rather than manual processes. Terraform is a popular IAC tool.

3. **Provider**:
   A provider in Terraform is a plugin that defines and manages the resources for a specific cloud or infrastructure platform, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes.

4. **Resource**:
   A resource is a component of your infrastructure, defined in Terraform configuration files. Examples include virtual machines, databases, networks, and more. Resources are managed by Terraform providers.

5. **Module**:
   A module in Terraform is a reusable set of Terraform configurations that encapsulates a specific piece of infrastructure. Modules make it easy to organize and share infrastructure code.

6. **State File**:
   Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. It records the relationship between your configuration and the resources created in the cloud. This file is crucial for making changes to your infrastructure.

7. **Plan**:
   Running `terraform plan` generates an execution plan that shows what actions Terraform will take to create, update, or delete resources based on your configuration. It helps you review changes before applying them.

8. **Apply**:
   `terraform apply` is the command used to execute the changes defined in your configuration. It creates or updates resources as specified.

9. **Destroy**:
   `terraform destroy` is the command used to tear down and delete all the resources created by Terraform in a specific configuration.

10. **Variable**:
    Variables in Terraform allow you to parameterize your configurations. They provide a way to pass values into your Terraform configuration and make it more flexible and reusable.
